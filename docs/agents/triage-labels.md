# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to
the label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

This repo tracks issues as local markdown files, so a "label" is the value of the
`Status:` line near the top of a ticket file.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill names a role, for example "apply the AFK-ready triage label", use the
matching label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you use.
